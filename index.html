        <p class="lead">Hi! My name is <strong>Jason Green</strong>. I'm an <strong>information technology professional</strong> from <strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>. It's nice to meet you...</p>
        <p>
            Are you looking for the kind of person that is so passionate about <strong>software development</strong>, <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>web design</strong>, that his New Year's resolutions for 2017 revolve around his <strong><a href="https://github.com/justjasongreen" target="_blank">GitHub contributions</a></strong> for the coming year?<br />
            <small>And I'm the kind of person who sticks to my New Year's resolutions!</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you looking for the kind of person that is so committed to keeping up with <strong>advancements in technology</strong>, that the first thing he does every morning is <strong>download the <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">daily free learning e-book from Packt Publishing</a></strong>?<br />
            <small>Yes, I did suffer withdrawal symptoms while the team at Packt Publishing were taking a break over Christmas!</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you looking for the kind of person that is so excited by the <strong>open source software</strong> movement, that he not only <strong>shares his own code freely and openly</strong>, but also <strong><a href="{{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}">writes about it</a> for the benefit of the open source community</strong>?<br />
            <small>I spend my spare time writing code for <a href="{{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}">personal projects</a> that excite me - but if anybody else finds that code useful, then that's great!</small>
        </p>
        <p>
            Are you looking for the kind of person that identifies as an <strong>information technology professional</strong>, but also embraces the fact that there is a <strong>real world beyond the computer screen</strong> too?<br />
            <small>Aviation, basketball, creative writing and photography are just some of my extra-curricular interests away from the computer!</small>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">If you answered <strong>YES</strong> to any or all of the above questions, please <a href="{{ '/curriculum-vitae/' | relative_url }}">read my curriculum vitae</a> and get in touch with me to discuss any employment opportunities that you have available!</p>
